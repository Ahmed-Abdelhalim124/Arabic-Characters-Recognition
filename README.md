# Arabic-Characters-Recognition
This project addresses the problem of recognizing Arabic handwritten characters using machine learning and deep learning approaches. It implements and compares a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with two different fully connected neural network architectures, evaluating their performance using k-fold cross-validation and test accuracy.

The goal is to develop a reliable classification system for 28 Arabic characters based on grayscale images (32Ã—32 pixels), and identify the model that achieves the best generalization on unseen data
